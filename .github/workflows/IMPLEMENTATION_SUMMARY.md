- Comprehensive deployment summaries

### 2. Updated Documentation
**File**: `.github/workflows/README.md`
- Added branch-based workflow to directory structure
- New dedicated section explaining the workflow
- Updated development workflow best practices
- Updated deployment strategy section
- Enhanced trigger documentation

### 3. Quick Reference Guide
**File**: `.github/workflows/BRANCH_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- 259 lines of comprehensive documentation
- Quick reference for common workflows
- Visual flow diagrams
- Troubleshooting guide
- Best practices and safety features

## 🌳 Branch → Environment Mapping

| Branch    | Environment(s) | Layers Deployed |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| `main`    | PROD + UAT    | All 7 layers    |
| `dev`     | DEV           | All 7 layers    |
| `staging` | QA            | All 7 layers    |

## 📋 Deployment Order

When triggered, the workflow deploys all layers sequentially:
1. Networking (VPC, Subnets, Endpoints)
2. Security (IAM, KMS, Security Groups)
3. Storage (S3, EFS)
4. Database (RDS, DynamoDB)
5. Compute (EKS, EC2, ASG)
6. DNS (Route53)
7. Monitoring (CloudWatch)

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start
```bash
# Deploy to DEV
git checkout dev
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin dev
# ✅ Automatically deploys to DEV

# Deploy to QA
git checkout staging
git merge dev
git push origin staging
# ✅ Automatically deploys to QA

# Deploy to PROD + UAT
git checkout main
git merge staging
git push origin main
# ✅ Automatically deploys to PROD and UAT
```

## 🔧 Next Steps

### 1. Verify GitHub Secrets
Ensure these secrets are configured in your repository settings:
```
Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Repository secrets
```

Required secrets:
- ✅ `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- ✅ `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- ✅ `AWS_REGION` (optional, defaults to us-east-1)

### 2. Set Up Branch Protection (Recommended)

#### For `main` branch:
- ✅ Require pull request reviews: 2 approvers
- ✅ Require status checks to pass
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date
- ✅ Include administrators

#### For `staging` branch:
- ✅ Require pull request reviews: 1 approver
- ✅ Require status checks to pass

#### For `dev` branch:
- ✅ Require status checks to pass (optional)

### 3. Test the Workflow

**Safe Test (Recommended)**:
1. Make a small, non-breaking change to a Terraform file
2. Commit to `dev` branch
3. Push to origin
4. Watch the workflow run in GitHub Actions
5. Verify deployment in AWS console

**Test Commands**:
```bash
git checkout dev
# Make a small change (e.g., add a tag)
git commit -m "test: verify branch-based deployment"
git push origin dev

# Monitor in GitHub
# Go to: Actions → Branch-Based Auto Deployment
```

### 4. Update Team Documentation

Consider adding links to the new workflow in:
- Your team's runbook
- Onboarding documentation
- Deployment procedures
- README.md in repository root

## 🔐 Security Features

### Concurrency Control
- ✅ Prevents overlapping deployments
- ✅ One deployment per branch at a time
- ✅ Safe queuing of multiple commits

### Path Filtering
Automatically ignores:
- ✅ `**.md` files (documentation)
- ✅ `docs/**` directory
- ✅ `.gitignore` and `LICENSE`

### Required Permissions
Workflow uses least-privilege permissions:
- ✅ `contents: read` - Read repository code
- ✅ `pull-requests: write` - Comment on PRs
- ✅ `issues: write` - Create/update issues

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

### GitHub Actions Dashboard
View real-time deployment status:
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Select "Branch-Based Auto Deployment"
3. View active and historical runs

### Deployment Summary
Each run provides:
- ✅ Environment(s) deployed to
- ✅ Status of each layer (7 layers × 1-2 environments)
- ✅ Commit information
- ✅ Triggered by user
- ✅ Timestamp

## 🆚 Comparison: Branch-Based vs. Manual Workflows

| Feature | Branch-Based | Manual Workflows |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Trigger** | Automatic on push | Manual dispatch |
| **Environments** | Based on branch | Selected by user |
| **Layers** | All 7 layers | Single or all layers |
| **Action** | Always `apply` | Choose: plan/apply/destroy |
| **Use Case** | Standard development flow | Specific deployments, testing |

## 💡 Best Practices

### ✅ DO
- Test in DEV before promoting
- Use the promotion flow: dev → staging → main
- Keep branches synchronized
- Monitor deployments in GitHub Actions
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Create pull requests for review

### ❌ DON'T
- Push directly to `main` without testing
- Skip the staging environment
- Deploy during peak hours without notice
- Ignore deployment failures
- Force push to protected branches
- Deploy multiple features at once

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Triggering
**Check**:
- Are you on `main`, `dev`, or `staging` branch?
- Did you only change documentation? (Ignored by design)
- Check Actions tab for errors

### Deployment Failed
**Steps**:
1. Review workflow logs in GitHub Actions
2. Identify failed layer
3. Check Terraform error messages
4. Verify AWS credentials and permissions
5. Check for state lock issues

### Need to Disable Auto-Deployment
**Options**:
1. Add `[skip ci]` to commit message
2. Push to a feature branch instead
3. Temporarily disable workflow file
