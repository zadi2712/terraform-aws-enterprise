## 🔍 Critical Files Verification

### Executable Scripts
```bash
# Verify permissions
ls -la deploy.sh destroy.sh scripts/*.sh

# Should show -rwxr-xr-x (executable)
```

### Directory Structure
```bash
# Verify they exist
ls -d docs/ layers/ modules/ scripts/ logs/ outputs/

# All should exist
```
