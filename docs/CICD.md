## 🏗️ Architecture

### Infrastructure Layers

The infrastructure is organized into 7 layers with dependencies:

```
1. networking  (Foundation: VPC, Subnets, VPC Endpoints)
   ↓
2. security    (IAM, KMS, Security Groups)
   ↓
3. storage     (S3, EFS)
   ↓
4. database    (RDS, DynamoDB)
   ↓
5. compute     (EKS, EC2, ASG)
   ↓
6. dns         (Route53)
   ↓
7. monitoring  (CloudWatch)
```

### Workflow Structure

```

## 📝 Workflows

### 1. Reusable Terraform Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/reusable-terraform.yml`

This is the core workflow that all layer-specific workflows call. It handles:

- ✅ Terraform initialization
- ✅ Validation and formatting checks
- ✅ Plan generation
- ✅ Apply/destroy operations
- ✅ PR comments with plan output
- ✅ Artifact uploading
- ✅ AWS credential configuration

**Inputs**:
- `layer`: Infrastructure layer name (required)
- `environment`: Target environment (required)
- `action`: Terraform action - plan/apply/destroy (required)
- `terraform_version`: Terraform version (optional, default: 1.9.0)

**Secrets**:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS access key (required)
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS secret key (required)
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region (optional, default: us-east-1)

**Outputs**:
- `plan_output`: Terraform plan output
- `plan_exitcode`: Plan exit code (0=no changes, 1=error, 2=changes)


### 2. Layer-Specific Workflows

Each layer has its own workflow with three trigger types:

#### A. Pull Request Trigger (Automatic Plan)
- **When**: PR opened/updated with changes to layer files
- **Action**: Runs `terraform plan` against dev environment
- **Output**: Posts plan as PR comment

#### B. Push Trigger (Automatic Deploy)
- **When**: Code merged to main branch
- **Action**: Runs `terraform apply` to dev environment
- **Output**: Deploys changes automatically

#### C. Manual Trigger (Workflow Dispatch)
- **When**: Manually triggered via GitHub UI
- **Action**: User selects environment and action
- **Output**: Executes chosen action on selected environment

**Example**: `deploy-networking.yml`

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:      # Manual trigger
  push:                   # Auto-deploy on merge to main
    branches: [main]
    paths: ['layers/networking/**']
  pull_request:           # Plan on PR
    branches: [main]
    paths: ['layers/networking/**']
```

### 3. Deploy All Layers Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/deploy-all-layers.yml`

Orchestrates deployment of all infrastructure layers in the correct dependency order.

**Features**:
- ✅ Sequential execution (networking → security → storage → database → compute → dns → monitoring)
- ✅ Skip specific layers via input parameter
- ✅ Continues on failure (doesn't stop entire pipeline)
- ✅ Comprehensive deployment summary

**Usage**:
```bash
# Deploy all layers to production
Trigger: Manual → Select "prod" → Select "apply"

# Deploy all layers except DNS and monitoring
Trigger: Manual → Skip layers: "dns,monitoring"
```

---

## 🚀 Setup Guide

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Secrets

Navigate to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add:

| Secret Name | Description | Example Value |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | AWS Access Key ID | `AKIA...` |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | AWS Secret Access Key | `wJalrX...` |
| `AWS_REGION` | Default AWS Region | `us-east-1` |

**Security Best Practice**: Use IAM roles with minimal permissions and enable MFA.

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Environments

Create environments for deployment protection:

1. Go to **Settings → Environments**
2. Create environments: `dev`, `qa`, `uat`, `prod`
3. For production:
   - ✅ Enable "Required reviewers" (1-2 reviewers)
   - ✅ Enable "Wait timer" (5-10 minutes)
   - ✅ Set "Deployment branches" to `main` only

### Step 3: Backend Configuration

Ensure each environment has a backend configuration file:

```hcl
# layers/networking/environments/dev/backend.tfvars
bucket         = "mycompany-terraform-state-dev"
key            = "networking/terraform.tfstate"
region         = "us-east-1"
dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock-dev"
encrypt        = true
```

### Step 4: Environment Variables

Create environment-specific `terraform.tfvars` files:

```hcl
# layers/networking/environments/prod/terraform.tfvars
environment = "prod"
vpc_cidr    = "10.0.0.0/16"
# ... other variables
```

### Step 5: Test the Pipeline

```bash
# 1. Create a test branch
git checkout -b test/pipeline

# 2. Make a small change to networking layer
echo "# Test change" >> layers/networking/README.md

# 3. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "test: pipeline validation"
git push origin test/pipeline

# 4. Create PR and verify plan appears in comments
# 5. Merge PR and verify auto-deployment to dev
```

---

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Deploy Networking to Development

**Via GitHub UI**:
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Select "Deploy Networking Layer"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select:
   - Environment: `dev`
   - Action: `plan`
5. Review plan output
6. Run again with action: `apply`

**Via Push**:
```bash
# Changes to networking layer auto-deploy to dev
git checkout main
echo "# Update" >> layers/networking/variables.tf
git commit -am "feat: update networking variables"
git push origin main
# → Automatically runs plan and apply to dev
```


### Example 2: Deploy All Layers to Production

```bash
# Step 1: Plan all layers
Actions → Deploy All Layers → Run workflow
  Environment: prod
  Action: plan

# Step 2: Review plan outputs for each layer

# Step 3: Apply all layers
Actions → Deploy All Layers → Run workflow
  Environment: prod
  Action: apply
  
# Step 4: Monitor deployment progress
# Each layer deploys sequentially with status updates
```

### Example 3: Emergency Rollback

```bash
# Option A: Destroy specific layer
Actions → Deploy Compute Layer → Run workflow
  Environment: prod
  Action: destroy

# Option B: Revert via Git
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main
# → Triggers automatic deployment of previous state
```

### Example 4: Deploy with Layer Skip

```bash
# Deploy all layers except monitoring (already deployed)
Actions → Deploy All Layers → Run workflow
  Environment: uat
  Action: apply
  Skip layers: monitoring
```

## ✅ Best Practices

### 1. Deployment Strategy

**Recommended Flow**:
```
1. Make changes in feature branch
2. Create PR → Automatic plan runs
3. Review plan in PR comments
4. Merge to main → Auto-deploys to dev
5. Manual deployment to qa (workflow dispatch)
6. Manual deployment to uat (workflow dispatch)
7. Manual deployment to prod (with approval)
```

### 2. Branching Strategy

```
main         (protected, auto-deploys to dev)
  ↑
develop      (integration branch)
  ↑
feature/*    (feature development)
hotfix/*     (emergency fixes)
```

### 3. Environment Promotion

```
dev → qa → uat → prod
```

**Progressive Deployment**:
- **dev**: Automatic on merge
- **qa**: Manual trigger after dev validation
- **uat**: Manual trigger after qa validation
- **prod**: Manual trigger with required approval

### 4. Code Review Requirements

- ✅ All PRs require at least 1 approval
- ✅ Terraform plan must complete successfully
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Production deployments require 2 approvals

### 5. State Management

```hcl
# Use separate state files per layer and environment
Key pattern: {layer}/{environment}/terraform.tfstate

Examples:
- networking/dev/terraform.tfstate
- networking/prod/terraform.tfstate
- compute/dev/terraform.tfstate
```

### 6. Monitoring Deployments

**During Deployment**:
- Monitor GitHub Actions logs
- Watch for Terraform errors
- Review plan before apply

**Post-Deployment**:
- Verify resources in AWS Console
- Check CloudWatch logs
- Run integration tests
- Validate application health

### 7. Handling Failures

**If Pipeline Fails**:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs
2. Review Terraform error output
3. Fix issue in code
4. Re-run workflow
5. If critical, use destroy and redeploy

**Common Failure Scenarios**:
- Resource already exists → Import into state
- Permission denied → Check IAM policies
- Invalid configuration → Validate locally first
- State lock → Release lock or wait for timeout

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### 1. Secrets Management

**DO**:
- ✅ Use GitHub Secrets for credentials
- ✅ Rotate credentials regularly (every 90 days)
- ✅ Use IAM roles with minimal permissions
- ✅ Enable MFA for AWS accounts
- ✅ Audit secret access regularly

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Hardcode credentials in code
- ❌ Share secrets via chat/email
- ❌ Use root AWS account
- ❌ Grant overly broad permissions

### 2. Environment Protection

```yaml
# Production environment should have:
- Required reviewers: 2 minimum
- Wait timer: 10 minutes (cooling-off period)
- Restricted to main branch only
- Deployment notification enabled
```

### 3. Least Privilege IAM Policy

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:*",
        "vpc:*",
        "s3:*",
        "rds:*",
        "eks:*",
        "iam:*",
        "kms:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:RequestedRegion": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Audit Logging

- Enable CloudTrail for all API calls
- Monitor GitHub Actions audit log
- Review deployment history regularly
- Set up alerts for unauthorized changes

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: "No backend configuration found"

**Error**:
```
Error: Backend configuration not found
```

**Solution**:
```bash
# Ensure backend.tfvars exists
ls -la layers/networking/environments/dev/backend.tfvars

# Check file permissions
chmod 644 layers/networking/environments/dev/backend.tfvars
```

#### Issue 2: "State lock could not be acquired"

**Error**:
```
Error acquiring the state lock
Lock Info:
  ID:        abc123
  Operation: OperationTypeApply
```

**Solution**:
```bash
# Wait for lock to release (if another deployment is running)
# OR force unlock (use with caution)
terraform force-unlock abc123
```

#### Issue 3: "Authentication failed"

**Error**:
```
Error: error configuring Terraform AWS Provider: IAM Role (arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/...) cannot be assumed
```

**Solution**:
1. Verify AWS credentials in GitHub Secrets
2. Check IAM role trust policy
3. Ensure MFA is not required (or configure it)
4. Verify region is correct

#### Issue 4: "Resource already exists"

**Error**:
```
Error: Error creating VPC: VpcLimitExceeded
```

**Solution**:
```bash
# Option A: Import existing resource
terraform import module.vpc.aws_vpc.main vpc-12345678

# Option B: Clean up unused resources
# Check AWS Console and remove manually

# Option C: Use different resource names
# Update terraform.tfvars with unique identifiers
```

#### Issue 5: "Plan shows no changes but resources not deployed"

**Solution**:
```bash
# Refresh state
terraform refresh

# Check for drift
terraform plan -refresh-only

# If drift detected, reconcile
terraform apply -refresh-only
```

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Can I deploy to production from a feature branch?

**A**: No. Production deployments are restricted to the `main` branch only via environment protection rules. This ensures all changes go through proper review and testing.

### Q2: What happens if a deployment fails midway?

**A**: The workflow will stop at the failed step. Terraform state is preserved, and you can:
1. Review the error in logs
2. Fix the issue
3. Re-run the workflow
4. Terraform will continue from where it left off

### Q3: Can I run multiple workflows simultaneously?

**A**: Each layer can run independently, but deployments to the same environment are serialized using concurrency controls to prevent state conflicts.

### Q4: How do I rollback a deployment?

**A**: You can:
1. Revert the commit and push to main (triggers auto-deployment)
2. Manually run the workflow with the previous configuration
3. Use `terraform destroy` and redeploy the previous version

### Q5: Where are Terraform state files stored?

**A**: State files are stored in S3 buckets specified in `backend.tfvars` with DynamoDB for state locking. Each layer and environment has its own state file.

### Q6: Can I skip Terraform plan and go straight to apply?

**A**: While possible, it's not recommended. Always review the plan first. The workflows enforce a plan step before apply for safety.

### Q7: How do I add a new layer?

**A**: 
1. Create layer directory: `layers/new-layer/`
2. Add Terraform files and environment configs
3. Copy an existing workflow file (e.g., `deploy-networking.yml`)
4. Modify for new layer name and paths
5. Add to `deploy-all-layers.yml` in appropriate order

### Q8: What if I need to deploy outside business hours?

**A**: Schedule deployments using GitHub's `schedule` trigger:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 0'  # Every Sunday at 2 AM UTC
```
