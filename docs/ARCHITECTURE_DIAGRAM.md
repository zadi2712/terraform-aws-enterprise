### Security Group Architecture

**Layered Security Groups:**

1. **ALB Security Group (alb-sg)**
   - Inbound: 443 from 0.0.0.0/0 (HTTPS)
   - Inbound: 80 from 0.0.0.0/0 (HTTP → redirect to HTTPS)
   - Outbound: All to application-sg on ports 8080, 8443

2. **Application Security Group (app-sg)**
   - Inbound: 8080, 8443 from alb-sg
   - Inbound: 443 from vpc-endpoint-sg (AWS services)
   - Outbound: 5432/3306 to database-sg (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
   - Outbound: 443 to 0.0.0.0/0 (API calls via NAT)
   - Outbound: 2049 to efs-sg (NFS)

3. **Database Security Group (db-sg)**
   - Inbound: 5432/3306 from app-sg only
   - Inbound: 5432/3306 from bastion-sg (admin access)
   - Outbound: None (no outbound required)

4. **EFS Security Group (efs-sg)**
   - Inbound: 2049 from app-sg (NFS)
   - Outbound: None

5. **Bastion Security Group (bastion-sg)**

### Route Table Configuration

**Public Route Table:**
```
Destination         Target
10.0.0.0/16        local
0.0.0.0/0          igw-xxxxx
```

**Private Route Table AZ1:**
```
Destination         Target
10.0.0.0/16        local
0.0.0.0/0          nat-xxxxx-az1
s3-prefix-list     vpce-s3-xxxxx
ddb-prefix-list    vpce-ddb-xxxxx
```

**Private Route Table AZ2:**
```
Destination         Target
10.0.0.0/16        local
0.0.0.0/0          nat-xxxxx-az2
s3-prefix-list     vpce-s3-xxxxx
ddb-prefix-list    vpce-ddb-xxxxx
```

## Data Flow Patterns

### User Request Flow (Web Application)

```
1. User → CloudFront (Edge Location)
   ↓
2. CloudFront → AWS WAF (DDoS protection, rule filtering)
   ↓
3. CloudFront → Route53 (DNS resolution, health checks)
   ↓
4. Route53 → Application Load Balancer (public subnet)
   ↓
5. ALB → Target Group (health check, sticky sessions)
   ↓
6. Target → ECS Task / EC2 Instance (private app subnet)
   ↓
7. Application → RDS Database (private data subnet)
   ↓
8. Application → S3 via VPC Endpoint (no internet gateway)
   ↓
9. Application → DynamoDB via VPC Endpoint
   ↓
10. Response ← Reverse path through ALB → CloudFront → User
```

### Internal Service Communication

```
ECS Service A → ECS Service B
├── Via Service Discovery (Cloud Map)
├── Via Internal ALB
└── Direct IP (with security groups)

Lambda → RDS
├── Lambda in VPC
├── Via ENI in private subnet
└── Security group allows Lambda → DB

EC2 → S3
├── Via S3 Gateway Endpoint (no internet)
├── Uses instance IAM role
└── Traffic stays within AWS network
```

### Outbound Internet Access

```
Private Subnet Resource → NAT Gateway → Internet Gateway → Internet
│
├── For software updates (yum, apt)
├── For third-party API calls
├── For webhook notifications
└── CloudWatch Logs via Interface Endpoint (no NAT needed)
```

### Backup and DR Data Flow

```
Production Resource → AWS Backup
├── Snapshot → S3 (encrypted with KMS)
├── S3 → Cross-Region Replication → DR Region
└── Retention → Lifecycle → Glacier → Deep Archive

RDS Primary (us-east-1a)
├── Synchronous Replication → RDS Standby (us-east-1b)
├── Asynchronous Replication → Read Replica (us-east-1c)
└── Asynchronous Replication → DR Read Replica (us-west-2)
```

## Operational Best Practices

### High Availability Design

**Multi-AZ Strategy:**
- All critical components deployed across at least 2 AZs
- Auto Scaling Groups span multiple AZs with balanced distribution
- RDS Multi-AZ for automatic failover (60-120 seconds)
- ECS services with minimum 2 tasks in different AZs
- ALB distributes traffic across healthy targets in all AZs
- NAT Gateways in each AZ to avoid single point of failure

**Health Checks:**
- ALB health checks: HTTP 200 on /health endpoint (30s interval)
- Target deregistration delay: 300 seconds for graceful shutdown
- ECS health checks: Docker HEALTHCHECK instruction
- Route53 health checks for global failover
- Auto Scaling health checks (EC2 + ELB)

**Auto Scaling Configuration:**
```
Target Tracking Policies:
- CPU Utilization: 70% target
- ALB Request Count per Target: 1000 requests
- Custom Metrics: Application-specific KPIs

Step Scaling Policies:
- Scale out: Add 2 instances when CPU > 80% for 5 minutes
- Scale in: Remove 1 instance when CPU < 30% for 15 minutes
- Cooldown periods: 300 seconds (scale out), 600 seconds (scale in)
```

---

### Security Best Practices

**Network Security:**
- Private subnets for all application and data tier resources
- Public subnets only for ALB, NAT Gateways, and Bastion
- Security groups follow least privilege principle
- Network ACLs as second layer of defense
- VPC Flow Logs enabled and monitored
- No direct internet access from private subnets

**Access Control:**
- No SSH keys stored in instances (use Systems Manager Session Manager)
- IAM roles for all AWS service access
- MFA required for console access
- Service Control Policies (SCPs) for account guardrails
- Regular access reviews and least privilege audits

**Data Protection:**
- All data encrypted at rest using KMS CMKs
- All data encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2+
- KMS key rotation enabled annually
- Separate encryption keys per environment
- Database credentials stored in Secrets Manager
- Automatic secret rotation every 30 days

**Monitoring & Detection:**
- GuardDuty for threat detection
- Security Hub for compliance posture
- Config Rules for resource compliance
- CloudTrail for API audit logging
- VPC Flow Logs for network traffic analysis
- Automated remediation for common security findings

---

### Performance Optimization

**Compute Optimization:**
- Right-sized instance types per environment:
  - Dev: t3.medium, t3a.medium (burstable)
  - QA/UAT: t3.large, m5.large (general purpose)
  - Prod: m5.xlarge, c5.xlarge (compute optimized)
- ECS Fargate for variable workloads
- Lambda for event-driven processing
- Spot Instances for non-critical, fault-tolerant workloads

**Database Optimization:**
- RDS Performance Insights for query analysis
- Appropriate instance sizing (db.t3.large → db.r5.large)
- Read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Connection pooling (RDS Proxy)
- Query result caching (ElastiCache/DAX)
- Proper indexing strategies

**Network Optimization:**
- CloudFront for static content delivery
- VPC endpoints to avoid NAT Gateway data charges
- S3 Transfer Acceleration for large uploads
- EFS with appropriate performance mode
- Placement groups for low-latency requirements

**Storage Optimization:**
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering for unknown access patterns
- EBS gp3 volumes with custom IOPS/throughput
- EFS lifecycle management to IA storage class
- Glacier for long-term archival
- S3 Object Lock for compliance

---

### Cost Management

**Resource Optimization:**
- Auto-scaling to match demand
- Scheduled scaling for predictable patterns
- Instance Scheduler for non-prod environments
- Lambda instead of always-on compute
- Fargate Spot for cost-effective containers

**Commitment Discounts:**
- Reserved Instances for predictable workloads (1-3 year)
- Savings Plans for flexible compute usage
- RDS Reserved Instances for databases
- ElastiCache Reserved Nodes

**Waste Reduction:**
- Automated shutdown of dev/qa environments (off-hours)
- Deletion of unused snapshots and AMIs
- Lifecycle policies for old logs
- Cleanup of unattached EBS volumes
- Regular cost review and optimization

**Monitoring & Alerts:**
- AWS Budgets with threshold alerts
- Cost anomaly detection
- Daily cost reports by service/tag
- Reserved Instance utilization tracking
- Savings Plans coverage monitoring
