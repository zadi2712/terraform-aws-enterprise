## 🎨 Visual Improvements Applied

### Color Coding System
```
🔵 Blue shades    → Compute resources (ECS, EC2, Lambda)
🟢 Green shades   → Data/storage (RDS, S3, DynamoDB)
🟡 Yellow shades  → Security (IAM, KMS, WAF)
🟣 Purple shades  → Monitoring (CloudWatch, X-Ray)
🟠 Orange shades  → Edge services (CloudFront, Route53)
```

### Emoji Icons Used
```
👥 Users          🐳 Containers      💻 Virtual Machines
⚡ Serverless     🗄️ Databases      📦 Storage
